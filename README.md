# Rackyview
An iOS mobile app.

_I'm going to send out one more update, 1.1, for viewing AgentInfo then all the source code will be in this repo and anyone can do whatever they want with it. Give me until after Anime Expo 2015; like July 12th._

The original Rackspace mobile team have long since departed; I'm the last one. I still have all the concept & mockups of the app they were going to build and I wanted to learn iOS swift. So as a final monument to one of the best teams I've worked with in my career, I decided to make my first ever mobile app follow their specs as closely as possible. Including the idea that the app should be very minimalistic in its approach to monitoring. As such, this app will never have anything close to all the features of the official Rackspace app nor the Rackspace website. This app's focus is almost exclusively alarms & tickets at a very high level; intended target is __Mostly Non-Technical People__. If you are a power user, I suggest the official Rackspace app and the Rackspace website controlPanel.
